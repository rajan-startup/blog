H3#@1.You are given 2 documents. We want to know how similar they are through N-Grams. 
ie:
Given an input n (n = number of word in the Ngram) and two documents(strings) find the intersection of the NGrams of two document. 

E.g doc1 = 'This is a dog' 
doc2 = 'This is a cat' 
n = 3 
Ngrams for doc1 = 'This is a', 'is a dog' 
Ngrams for doc2 = 'This is a', 'is a cat' 
Output 'This is a'

H3#@3. Given an unbalanced binary tree, write code to select a node at random (each node has an equal probability of being selected).
CODE_START#
START_SNIPPET
You can do it with a single pass of the tree. The algorithm is the same as with a list.

When you see the first item in the tree, you set it as the selected item.

When you see the second item, you pick a random number in the range (0,2]. If it's 1, then the new item becomes the selected item. Otherwise you skip that item.

For each node you see, you increase the count, and with probability 1/count, you select it. So at the 101st node, you pick a random number in the range (0,101]. If it's 100, that node is the new selected node.

When you're done traversing the tree, return the selected node. The operation is O(n) in time, with n being the number of nodes in the tree, and O(1) in space. No preprocessing required.

Explaination;
For example with 2 nodes you select the first item. Then when you see the second item you replace the first item with probability 1/2. When you see the third item, you replace the selected item with probability 1/3. Every item has equal probability of being the selected item.
-> you have 5 nodes:
(1) check 2nd node: (0,1)=>1 => current=2
(2) check 3 node: (0,2)=>1 => current=2
(3) check 4 node: (0,3)=>3 => current=4
(4) check 5 node: (0,4)=>2 => current=4

H3#@6. TreeSet vs HashSet
HashSet is much faster than TreeSet (constant-time versus log-time for most operations like add, remove and contains) but offers no ordering guarantees like TreeSet.

HashSet

class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size).
it does not guarantee that the order of elements will remain constant over time
iteration performance depends on the initial capacity and the load factor of the HashSet.
It's quite safe to accept default load factor but you may want to specify an initial capacity that's about twice the size to which you expect the set to grow.
TreeSet

guarantees log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains)
guarantees that elements of set will be sorted (ascending, natural, or the one specified by you via its constructor) (implements SortedSet)
doesn't offer any tuning parameters for iteration performance
offers a few handy methods to deal with the ordered set like first(), last(), headSet(), and tailSet() etc
Important points:

Both guarantee duplicate-free collection of elements
It is generally faster to add elements to the HashSet and then convert the collection to a TreeSet for a duplicate-free sorted traversal.
None of these implementation are synchronized. That is if multiple threads access a set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally.
LinkedHashSet is in some sense intermediate between HashSet and TreeSet. Implemented as a hash table with a linked list running through it, however it provides insertion-ordered iteration which is not same as sorted traversal guaranteed by TreeSet.
So choice of usage depends entirely on your needs but I feel that even if you need an ordered collection then you should still prefer HashSet to create the Set and then convert it into TreeSet.

e.g. SortedSet< String> s = new TreeSet< String>(hashSet);

H3#@7. You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. 
Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j).

Output: N = 10001010100

 int left = max - ((1 < <  j) - 1);

 // 1âs after position i
 int right = ((1 < <  i) - 1);

H3#@8. How to find if number if power of 2.

Ans: if (n & (n-1)) = 0

What does it mean if A & B == 0?
It means that A and B never have a 1 bit in the same place. So if n & (n-1) == 0, then n and
n-1 never share a 1.
What does n-1 look like (as compared with n)?
Try doing subtraction by hand (in base 2 or 10). What happens?
 1101011000 [base 2]
- 1
= 1101010111 [base 2]
 593100 [base 10]
- 1
= 593099 [base 10]
When you subtract 1 from a number, you look at the least significant bit. If itâs a 1 you change
it to zero and you are done. If itâs a zero, you must âborrowâ from a larger bit. So, you go to
increasingly larger bits, changing each bit from a 0 to a 1, until you find a 1. You flip that one
to a 0 and you are done.
Thus, n-1 will look like n, except that nâs initial 0s will be 1âs in n-1, and nâs least significant 1
will be a 0 in (n-1). That is:
if n = abcde1000
then n-1 = abcde0111
So what does n & (n-1) == 0 indicate?
n and (n-1) must have no 1s in common. Given that they look like this:
if n = abcde1000
then n-1 = abcde0111
abcde must be all 0s, which means that n must look like this: 00001000. n is therefore a
power of two.
So, we have our answer: ((n & (n-1)) == 0) checks if n is a power of 2 (or 0)

H3#@9. Write a function to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B.
Input: 31, 14 :    11111 , 01110
Output: 2
Ans: if you XOR : 1^0 = 1
C= A^B
while(C>0){
count+=c>>1;
}

H3#@10. Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, etc).

Mask all odd bits with 10101010 in binary (which is 0xAA), then shift them left to put them in
the even bits. Then, perform a similar operation for even bits. This takes a total 5 instructions.

H3#@15. Inorder Binary Tree Traversal with Constant Space
It first modify the tree to a partial Threaded Binary Tree where all right child pointers that were null in the original tree are pointed to their inorder successor.
With that information in hand, it is much easier to conduct an inorder traversal: Go to the left most node, and follow right pointers to complete the traversal.
During the traversal, Morris algorithm then fix the modified right pointers and set them back to null.

An inorder traversal can be implemented using recursion or stack (see previous post). But both methods requires O(h) space, where h is the height of the tree. That said, the worst case space complexity can be O(n).

H3#@16. Design LRU cache.

This algorithm touches each node at most three times: find successor, visit, fix right pointer of pre node. So, it runs in time O(n) and uses O(1) space!
We need a data structure to check whether a page number is in cache in constant time. HashMap with each page number as a key can make it.

We also need a data structure to maintain page numbers in cache in the order of their access time. One way to do that is to keep a timestamp field for each record, but we still need to sort them which cannot be done in O(1) time. Alternatively, we can use a linked list to keep all records, and move the newly visited one to the head of the list. To get O(1) time complexity for updating such a linked list, we need a doubly linked list.

Each time when a new page number comes in,
- If it is already in the cache, move the node to the head of the linked list;
- If it is not in the cache, insert it to the head of the linked list and update the current capacity of the cache. If the cache is full, remove the last node of the linked list. (So, we also need a tail pointer. :)

H3#@18. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Write a function which takes an array and returns the majority element (if it exists), otherwise returns null.

Given an array of [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4], return null.

Essentially, if we are finding element is more than n/2 => it means it must be appearing consecutively. 
So, we should compare with previous element and move forward. and 
1. we can also maintain the counter
a. if consecutive matches then store that value in temp and increment
b. if not match then reduce counter and once counter reaches again to =0; again store the value in temp

Convert the board to node sets < 'S', [(1, 0), (1, 3)]>, < 'E', [(0, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)]>.
For 'S' at (1, 0), there is no adjacent 'E';
For 'S' at (1, 3), the 2nd 'E' can be (0, 3), but then there is no adjacent 'E' next to the 2nd 'E'; 
the 2nd 'E' can also be (2, 3) and the 3rd 'E' will be (2, 2).

Notice that we still perform DFS-like actions on those nodes but the size of node set could be smaller than the original matrix.

BOX_START#
START_BOX_CONTENT
Is it possible to have leading/trailing spaces?
Possibly. Leading/trailing spaces can be ignored. That said, "   90   " is okay but "9 0" is not.
Is sign (+/-) accepted?
Yes. "+10", "-3", "10" are all valid.
Is decimals accepted?
Yes. "2.413", ".413", and "143." are all valid.
Is hexadecimal accepted?
No. "0x34AF" can be treated as invalid.
Is it possible to use "E notation"?
Yes. But you can assume power is integer, i.e. "89e9" and "1.23e4" is an valid input but "52e4.2" is not. Also, both power and exponent may have sign and , e.g. "+23e-3".

So, an valid input could be something like
(space)*[+-]?([0-9]+|[0-9]*\.[0-9]+|[0-9]+\.[0-9]*)([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?(space)*$
where '*' means 0 or more occurrences, '+' means 1 or more occurrence, and '?' means 0 or 1.

H3#@30. Surrounded Regions

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region .

For example,
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

b#@Solution
The algorithm will be something like:
Start from those boundary cells, use BFS or DFS to traverse all non-flipable 'O' cells, 
and mark them with a special sign, say 'N'.
Revisit the board, flip all remaining 'O' cells to 'X' and also flip back 'N' cells to 'O'.
Notice that for each boundary cell, no matter what value it has, it will never be flipped.
Also, for the four corner cells, their value will not impact any other cells.

H3#@33. Subsets - No Duplicates

Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.

Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
For example,
If S = [1,2,3], a solution is: [[3],[1], [2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2], []]

b#@Solution
1. sort the array
2. recurrsion and keep Array of string/array
3. make sure appending char should be > than previous one and not equal to previous one
in that way we can prevent

H3#@37. Regex Wildcard Matching
Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") ? false
isMatch("aa","aa") ? true
isMatch("aaa","aa") ? false
isMatch("aa", "*") ? true
isMatch("aa", "a*") ? true
isMatch("ab", "?*") ? true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") ? false

b#@Solution
We can use similar ideas to solve this problem.
If current of p is not '*', try to match single char. If succeed, move to next; if fail, fail.
If current of p is '*', firstly, skip duplicate '*'s; then use backtracking to test all subsequences of s.

Zigzag level order traversal: from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between.

b#@Solution
In this case, we need a LIFO stack for each level so that it could return nodes in a reverse order as we push in. Also, we need to check whether the level is odd level or even and when we read current level from right to left, we need to push right children and then left child for each node.

H3#@49. Sliding Window to find maximum number
A long array A[] is given to you. There is a sliding window of size w which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the w numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. Following is an example: The array is [1 3 -1 -3 5 3 6 7], and w is 3.

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Input: A long array A[], and a window width w
Output: An array B[], B[i] is the maximum value of from A[i] to A[i+w-1]
Requirement: Find a good optimal way to get B[]

b#@Solution

1. We will use ArrayDeque< > : as it has getFirst(), addLast(), removeLast()
- Make sure first element will be always big
- so, when you add in last: make sure current last should be bigger than insertion
- else remove all last till we make sure we have higher number while getting from first

It's like in Queue we will insert elements and when window ends, we will get Max element
ie:
1,3,-1,2,0
Window 1: 1,3,-1
-1-
-remove 1-
-3-
-3,-1-
Max: first = 3
Window 2: 3,-1,1
-Clean 1st window: so always store index
-3,-1-
-3,2-
Max: 3
Window 3: -1,2,0
-Clean 2nd window
-2-
-2,0-
max: 2

It means If we consider it as a train:
-ENgine has to be max
- and add 
2. Now, we will insert the index of element for each window
3. ie:
a. Insert : index(1) : addLast(0)
b. Now insert 3 in the last: but make sure

img#@http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EKJWTW9077U/UUgAKv5NiOI/AAAAAAAAEa0/WGI9HYIxUcY/s320/histogram_area.png
The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

For example, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3], return 10.

b#@Solution
Notice that we only push a new item into stack when the new item is no less than the top one in the stack. That said, when we pop up an item, the new top in the stack is the first one (go backwards from the popped one) that is smaller than the popped one, which implies that the left boundary of the current rectangle is top+1, inclusively.
Also, when we pop it up, it means that we hit a new height that is smaller than it, which implies that the right boundary is cur-1, inclusively.

With these information in hand, we only need to maintain one stack!

     } else {  
       int top = left.pop();  
       // the height at left.peek() must be smaller than the current one

       area = Math.max(area, height[top]*(left.isEmpty() ? cur : (cur-left.peek()-1)));

  b) From m2 to last element of ar2 (ar2[|_n/2_|...n-1])
4) If m2 is greater than m1, then median is present in one of the below two subarrays.
  a) From m1 to last element of ar1 (ar1[|_n/2_|...n-1])
  b) From first element of ar2 to m2 (ar2[0...|_n/2_|])
5) Repeat the above process until size of both the subarrays becomes 2.

H3#@84. Candy
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

This problem can be solved in O(n) time.

We can always assign a neighbor with 1 more if the neighbor has higher a rating value. However, to get the minimum total number, we should always start adding 1s in the ascending order. We can solve this problem by scanning the array from both sides. First, scan the array from left to right, and assign values for all the ascending pairs. Then scan from right to left and assign values to descending pairs.


CODE_START#

public int candy(int[] ratings) {

      // if not ascending, assign 1

H3#@92. Reorder Linked List.

Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→ ... →Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→...

For example, given {1,2,3,4}, reorder it to {1,4,2,3}. You must do this in-place without altering the nodes' values.

Analysis

This problem is not straightforward, because it requires "in-place" operations. That means we can only change their pointers, not creating a new list.

Java Solution

This problem can be solved by doing the following:

Break list in the middle to two lists (use fast & slow pointers)
Reverse the order of the second list
Merge two list back together
The following code is a complete runnable class with testing.

H3#@95. Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

A:          a1 -> a2
                    ->
                      c1 -> c2 -> c3
                    ->           
B:     b1 -> b2 -> b3
begin to intersect at node c1.

First calculate the length of two lists and find the difference. Then start from the longer list at the diff offset, iterate though 2 lists and find the node.

H3#@111. Dungeon Game
The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0’s) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight’s health (positive integers).
In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
Write a function to determine the knight’s minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

H3#@112. Repeated DNA Sequences 
For example, given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT", return: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

The key to solve this problem is that each of the 4 nucleotides can be stored in 2 bits. So the 10-letter-long sequence can be converted to 20-bits-long integer. The following is a Java solution. You may use an example to manually execute the program and see how it works.

CODE_START#
START_SNIPPET
public List< String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {

  int len = s.length();
  if (len < 10) {

  map.put('A', 0);
  map.put('C', 1);
  map.put('G', 2);
  map.put('T', 3);

  Set< Integer> added = new HashSet< Integer>();
 
  int hash = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (i < 9) {
      //each ACGT fit 2 bits, so left shift 2
      hash = (hash < < 2) + map.get(s.charAt(i)); 
    } else {
      hash = (hash < < 2) + map.get(s.charAt(i));
      //make length of hash to be 20
      hash = hash &  (1 < < 20) - 1;

H3#@113. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range 
Given a range [m, n] where 0 < =  m < =  n < =  2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive. For example, given the range [5, 7], you should return 4.

The key to solve this problem is bitwise AND consecutive numbers. You can use the following example to walk through the code.

    8  4  2  1
---------------
5 | 0  1  0  1
6 | 0  1  1  0
7 | 0  1  1  1

When you do : n & (n-1) => It will remove least significant 1
ie:
X=7&6 = 0110 =6
Y=6&5 = 0100 = 4


CODE_START#
START_SNIPPET
